# This is Spring app CRM REST API with SPRING SECURITY.We was using Hibernate API and all CRUD methods with database.We created 4 JAVA CONFIG CLASSES, because we are using PURE JAVA CONFIG, NO XML.Two config classes are for SPRING SECURITY.In this case we do memory authentication and we added authorities(roles) for some users.Depending on the roles, user can execute CRUD operation on database(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).We was using POSTMAN REST CLIENT to test all HTTP REQUEST METHODS (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
